# Gesture-Control-System
This Gesture Control System allows users to control various system functions (like mouse movement, volume adjustment, and screen brightness) using hand gestures through a webcam. It leverages MediaPipe for hand tracking and PyAutoGUI for controlling the system. The project enables intuitive, hands-free control for everyday tasks.
